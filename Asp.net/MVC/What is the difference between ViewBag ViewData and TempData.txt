What is the difference between ViewBag ViewData and TempData

ViewBag:
	1: ViewBag is a dynamic property.
	2: ViewBag's life only lasts during the current http request. 
	   ViewBag values will be null if redirection occurs.
	3: ViewBag is actually a wrapper around ViewData.
	
	@ViewBag.Name  <---------- ViewBag.Name = "Tom"
	    View                       Controller
		
ViewData:
	1: It must cast ViewData values to the appropriate data type.
	2: ViewData and ViewBag both use the same dictionary internally. 
	   So you cannot have ViewData Key matches with the property name of ViewBag
		ViewBag.Id = 1;
		ViewData.Add("Id", 1); // throw runtime exception as it already has "Id" key
		
	@ViewData["Name"]  <---------- ViewData["Name"] = "Tom"
	    View                       Controller

TempData:
	1: It can be used to store temporary data which can be used in the subsequent request.
	2: TempData will be cleared out after the completion of a subsequent request.
	3: TempData is useful when you want to transfer non-sensitive data from one action method to 
		another action method of the same or a different controller as well as redirects.
	4: you can't get the same data in the third request because TempData will be cleared out after second request.
		Call TempData.Keep() to retain TempData values in a third consecutive request.
	5: TempData value must be type cast before use. Check for null values to avoid runtime error.
	6: TempData can be used to store only one time messages like error messages, validation messages.

	var model= TempData["ModelName"];  <---------- TempData["ModelName"] = model;
	    Controller                                     Controller
