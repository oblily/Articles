HTML(5) Style Guide and Coding Conventions
Use Correct Document Type
	<!DOCTYPE html>
Use Lower Case Element Names
Close All HTML Elements
Close Empty HTML Elements
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
Use Lower Case Attribute Names
Quote Attribute Values
Image Attributes
	Always use the alt attribute with images. It is important when the image cannot be viewed.
	Always define image size. It reduces flickering because the browser can reserve space for images before they are loaded.
	<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5" style="width:128px;height:128px">
Spaces and Equal Signs
	space-less is easier to read, and groups entities better together:
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Avoid Long Code Lines
	Try to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
Blank Lines and Indentation
	Do not add blank lines without a reason.
	For readability, add 2 spaces of indentation. Do not use TAB.
Meta Data
	The <title> element is required in HTML5. 
	To ensure proper interpretation, and correct search engine indexing, both the language and the character encoding should be defined as early as possible in a document:
	<html lang="en-US">
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
Style Sheets
	Use simple syntax for linking style sheets (the type attribute is not necessary):
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
	Short rules can be written compressed, on one line, like this:
		p.into {font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16em;}
	Long rules should be written over multiple lines:
		body {
  		  background-color: lightgrey;
  		  font-family: "Arial Black", Helvetica, sans-serif;
  		  font-size: 16em;
  		  color: black;
		}
		Place the opening bracket on the same line as the selector.
		Use one space before the opening bracket.
		Use 2 spaces of indentation.
		Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
		Use space after each comma or semicolon.
		Use semicolon after each property-value pair, including the last.
		Only use quotes around values if the value contains spaces.
		Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
		Avoid lines over 80 characters.
Use Lower Case File Names
	Most web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names
	Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive
