The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration								
	The doctype declaration is not case sensitive.							
		<!DOCTYPE html>						
		<!DOCTYPE HTML>						
		ÅcÅcÅc.						
								
	<p title="About W3Schools">							
		When you move the mouse over the element, the title will be displayed as a tooltip.						
								
The alt Attribute								
	The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an HTML element cannot be displayed.							
								
	The value of the attribute can be read by "screen readers". This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, i.e. a blind person, can "hear" the element.							
		<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">						
								
We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes								
We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values					use pair style in common			
								
Headings Are Important								
	Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.							
	Search engines use your headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.							
								
The HTML <head> Element								
	The HTML <head> element has nothing to do with HTML headings.							
	The HTML <head> element contains meta data. Meta data are not displayed.							
	The HTML <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag:							
		<title>My First HTML</title>			The HTML <title> element is meta data. It defines the HTML document's title.			
					The title will not be displayed in the document, but might be displayed in the browser tab.			
					The <title> element is required in all HTML/XHTML documents.			
								
					The <title> element:			
					defines a title in the browser tab			
					provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites			
					displays a title for the page in search engine results			
								
								
		<meta charset="UTF-8">						
					The HTML <style> element is used to define internal CSS style sheets.			
					The HTML <link> element is used to define external CSS style sheets.			
	Meta data means data about data. HTML meta data is data about the HTML document.							
								
	The HTML <link> Element							
		The <link> element defines the page relationship to an external resource.						
		The <link> element is most often used to link to style sheets:						
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">					
								
HTML Display								
	With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.							
	The browser will remove extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed.							
	Any number of spaces, and any number of new lines, count as only one space.							
								
The HTML <pre> Element								
	The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.							
	The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:							
								
Styling HTML with CSS								
	Styling can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:							
		Inline - using a style attribute in HTML elements						
		Internal - using a <style> element in the HTML <head> section						
		External - using one or more external CSS files						
								
The CSS Box Model								
	Every HTML element has a box around it, even if you cannot see it.							
	The CSS border property defines a visible border around an HTML element:							
		border:1px solid black;						
								
	The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) inside the border:							
	The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border:							
								
HTML Images								
	Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page will flicker while the image loads.							
								
	The alt Attribute							
		If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the alt text:						
		<img src="wrongname.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">						
		The alt attribute is required. A web page will not validate correctly without it.						
HTML Screen Readers								
	A screen reader is a software program that can read what is displayed on a screen.							
	Screen readers are useful to people who are blind, visually impaired, or learning disabled.							
	Screen readers can read the alt attribute.							
								
Width and Height or Style?								
	Both the width, height, and style attributes are valid in the latest HTML5 standard.							
	We suggest you use the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the original size of images:							
	<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">							
	<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">							ä©ÇﬂÇ»Ç¢
								
Using an Image as a Link								
	To use an image as a link, simply nest the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:							
		<a href="default.asp">						
			<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">					
		</a>						
		Add "border:0;" to prevent IE9 (and earlier) from displaying a border around the image.						
								
HTML Table Headings								
	Table headings are defined with the <th> tag.							
	By default, all major browsers display table headings as bold and centered:							
								
An HTML Table with Border Spacing								
	Border spacing specifies the space between the cells.							
	To set the border spacing for a table, use the CSS border-spacing property:							
		table {						
		    border-spacing: 5px;						
		}						
	If the table has collapsed borders, border-spacing has no effect.							
								
Unordered HTML Lists								
	An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.							
	The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles):							
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">							
		list-style-type:disc The list items will be marked with bullets (default)						
		list-style-type:circle The list items will be marked with circles						
		list-style-type:square The list items will be marked with squares						
		list-style-type:none The list items will not be marked						
								
Ordered HTML Lists								
	An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.							
	The list items will be marked with numbers:							
		type="1"	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)					
		type="A"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters					
		type="a"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters					
		type="I"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers					
		type="i"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers					
	<ol type="1">							
								
HTML Description Lists								
	A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.							
	The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:							
								
HTML Block and Inline Elements								
	Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.							
								
	Block-level Elements							
		A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).						
								
		Examples of block-level elements:						
		<div>		often used as a container for other HTML elements.				
			The <div> element has no required attributes, but style and class are common.					
		<h1> - <h6>						
		<p>						
		<form>						
	Inline Elements							
		An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.						
		Examples of inline elements:						
		<span>		often used as a container for some text.				
				The <span> element has no required attributes, but style and class are common.				
		<a>						
		<img>						
								
Website Layout Using HTML5								
								
		<header>						
								
		<nav>			nav Defines a container for navigation links			
								
	<section>						
								
			<aside>					
								
								
	<article>			article Defines an independent self-contained article			
								
								
		<footer>						
								
								
HTML Responsive Web Design								
	Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).							
								
HTML Iframes								
	<iframe src="URL"></iframe>							
	Use the height and width attributes to specify the size.							
		<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" width="200" height="200"></iframe>						
				The attribute values are specified in pixels by default, but they can also be in percent (like "80%").				
	Use iframe as a Target for a Link							
		An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link.						
		The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe:						
			<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" name="iframe_a"></iframe>					
			<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="iframe_a">W3Schools.com</a></p>					
								
The HTML <noscript> Tag								
	The <noscript> tag is used to provide an alternate content for users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support client-side scripting.							
	<noscript>Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript>							
								
Omitting <html> and <body>?								
	In the HTML5 standard, the <html> tag, the <body> tag, and the <head> tag can be omitted.							
	Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines.							
		<html lang="en-US">						
	Omitting <html> and <body> can crash badly-written DOM/XML software.							
	Finally, omitting <body> can produce errors in older browsers (IE9).							
								
								
HTML Entities								
	Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.							
	Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.							
		&entity_name;						
		OR						
		&#entity_number;						
		To display a less than sign we must write: &lt; or &#60;					<	
		The advantage of using an entity name, instead of a number, is that the name is easier to remember.						
								
	A common character entity used in HTML is the non-breaking space (&nbsp;).							
		Remember that browsers will always truncate spaces in HTML pages. If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.						
								
		<	&lt;					
		>	greater than	&gt;	&#62;

Text Input								
	<input type="text"> defines a one-line input field for text input:							
		Also note that the default width of a text field is 20 characters.						
								
The Name Attribute								
	To be submitted correctly, each input field must have a name attribute.							
	Notice that the value of the "First name" field will not be submitted, because the input element does not have a name attribute.							
								
Grouping Form Data with <fieldset>								
	The <fieldset> element groups related data in a form.							
	The <legend> element defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.							group.name
								
Input Type: password								
	<input type="password"> defines a password field:							
	The characters in a password field are masked (shown as asterisks or circles).							
								
Input Type: submit								
	<input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting form input to a form-handler.							
	If you omit the submit button's value attribute, the button will get a default text:							
								
HTML5 Input Types								
	HTML5 added several new input types							
		color						
		date						
		datetime						
		datetime-local						
		email						
		month						
		number						
		range						
		search						
		tel						
		time						
		url						
		week						
								
The readonly Attribute								
	The readonly attribute specifies that the input field is read only (cannot be changed):							
	The readonly attribute does not need a value. It is the same as writing readonly="readonly".							
		<input type="text" name="firstname" value="John" readonly>						
								
The disabled Attribute								
	The disabled attribute specifies that the input field is disabled.							
	A disabled element is un-usable and un-clickable.							
	Disabled elements will not be submitted.							
	The disabled attribute does not need a value. It is the same as writing disabled="disabled".							
The autofocus Attribute								
	The autofocus attribute of the input tag is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.							
	First name:<input type="text" name="fname" autofocus><br>							
	When present, it specifies that an <input> element should automatically get focus when the page loads.							
								
HTML5 Elements								
	HTML5 defines eight new semantic HTML elements. All these are block-level elements.							
	To secure correct behavior in older browsers, you can set the CSS display property to block:							
		header, section, footer, aside, nav, main, article, figure {						
		    display: block; 						
		}						
	Internet Explorer 8 and earlier, does not allow styling of unknown elements.							
		<!--[if lt IE 9]>						
			<script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>					
		<![endif]-->						
		The code above is a comment, but versions previous to IE9 will read it (and understand it).						
		The link to the shiv code must be placed in the <head> element, because Internet Explorer needs to know about all new elements before reading them.						
								
								
XML Stores New Line as LF								
Windows applications store a new line as: carriage return and line feed (CR+LF).								
								
Unix and Mac OSX uses LF.								
								
Old Mac systems uses CR.								
								
XML stores a new line as LF.
