												
what JavaScript can do.												
	JavaScript Can Change HTML Content											
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";										
	JavaScript Can Change HTML Attributes											
	JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)											
		document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";										
	JavaScript Can Validate Data											
		document.getElementById("numb").value										
												
JavaScript can be placed in the <body> and the <head> sections of an HTML page.												
	It is a good idea to place scripts at the bottom of the <body> element.											
	This can improve page load, because HTML display is not blocked by scripts loading.											
												
JavaScript Display Possibilities												
	JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:											
		Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().										
		Writing into the HTML output using document.write().										
			Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded, will delete all existing HTML:									
		Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.										
		Writing into the browser console, using console.log().										
												
JavaScript Statements												
	JavaScript Values											
		Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.										
	JavaScript Operators											
		JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:										
		JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - *  / ) to compute values:										
	JavaScript Comments											
		Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.										
												
JavaScript is Case Sensitive												
	The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.											
												
JavaScript Numbers												
	JavaScript has only one type of numbers.											
	Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:											
												
	’F	Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are considered accurate up to 15 digits.										
			var x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999									
			var y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000									
		The maximum number of decimals is 17, but floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate:										
			var x = 0.2 + 0.1;         // x will be 0.30000000000000004									
		To solve the problem above, it helps to multiply and divide:										
			var x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10;       // x will be 0.3									
		Division by 0 (zero) also generates Infinity:										
			var x =  2 / 0;          // x will be Infinity									
			var y = -2 / 0;          // y will be -Infinity									
		Infinity is a number: typeOf Infinity returns number.										
			typeof Infinity;        // returns "number"									
		var x = 100 / "Apple";  // x will be NaN (Not a Number)						isNaN(x);               // returns true because x is Not a Number				
		However, if the string contains a numeric value , the result will be a number:										
			var x = 100 / "10";     // x will be 10									
		Using myNumber.MAX_VALUE, where myNumber is a variable, expression, or value, will return undefined:										
			var x = 6;									
			var y = x.MAX_VALUE;    // y becomes undefined									
												
												
												
												
												
												
JavaScript Arrays												
	JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.											
		var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];										
												
JavaScript Objects												
	JavaScript objects are written with curly braces.											
		var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};										
												
Undefined												
	In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The typeof is also undefined.											
		var person;                  // Value is undefined, type is undefined										
		var person = null;           // Value is null, but type is still an object										
		var person = undefined;     // Value is undefined, type is undefined										
		null === undefined           // false										
		null == undefined            // true										
												
Automatically Global												
	If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.											
	function myFunction() {											
		carName = "Volvo";										
	}	even if it is executed inside a function										
												
JavaScript Data Types												
	In JavaScript there are 5 different data types that can contain values:											
		string										
		number										
		boolean										
		object										
		function										
	There are 3 types of objects:											
		Object										
		Date		You cannot use typeof to determine if a JavaScript object is an array (or a date).								
		Array		function isArray(myArray) {							function isDate(myDate) {	
					return myArray.constructor.toString().indexOf("Array") > -1;							return myDate.constructor.toString().indexOf("Date") > -1;
				}							}	
												
	And 2 data types that cannot contain values:											
		null										
		undefined										
												
The Unary + Operator												
	The unary + operator can be used to convert a variable to a number:											
		var y = "5";      // y is a string										
		var x = + y;      // x is a number										
												
		var y = "John";   // y is a string										
		var x = + y;      // x is a number (NaN)										
												
												
JavaScript Best Practices												
	Avoid global variables,  avoid new,  avoid  ==,  avoid eval()											
	Always Declare Local Variables											
		Local variables must be declared with the var keyword, otherwise they will become global variables.										
	Declarations on Top											
		By default, JavaScript moves all declarations to the top (JavaScript hoisting).										
	Initialize Variables											
	Never Declare Number, String, or Boolean Objects											
		Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects.										
	Don't Use new Object()											
		Use {} instead of new Object()				var x1 = {};           // new object						
		Use "" instead of new String()				var x2 = "";           // new primitive string						
		Use 0 instead of new Number()				var x3 = 0;            // new primitive number						
		Use false instead of new Boolean()				var x4 = false;        // new primitive boolean						
		Use [] instead of new Array()				var x5 = [];           // new array object						
		Use /()/ instead of new RegExp()				var x6 = /()/;         // new regexp object						
		Use function (){} instead of new function()				var x7 = function(){}; // new function object						
	Beware of Automatic Type Conversions											
		Beware that numbers can accidentally be converted to strings or NaN (Not a Number).										
			var x = "Hello";     // typeof x is a string									
			x = 5;               // changes typeof x to a number									
		Subtracting a string from a string, does not generate an error but returns NaN (Not a Number):										
			"Hello" - "Dolly"    // returns NaN									
	Use === Comparison											
		The == comparison operator always converts (to matching types) before comparison.										
			0 == "";        // true									
			1 == "1";       // true									
			1 == true;      // true									
	Use Parameter Defaults											
		If a function is called with a missing argument, the value of the missing argument is set to undefined.										
	End Your Switches with Defaults											
	Avoid Using eval()											
	Undefined is Not Null											
		With JavaScript, null is for objects, undefined is for variables, properties, and methods.										
		If you want to test if an object exists, this will throw an error if the object is undefined:										
			if (myObj !== null && typeof myObj !== "undefined") 									
		Because of this, you must test typeof() first:										
			if (typeof myObj !== "undefined" && myObj !== null) 									
												
JavaScript Performance												
	How to speed up your JavaScript code.											
												
	Reduce Activity in Loops											
		Bad Code:	for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {									
		Better Code:		l = arr.length;								
				for (i = 0; i < l; i++) {								
	Reduce DOM Access											
		Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.										
		If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:										
			obj = document.getElementById("demo");									
			obj.innerHTML = "Hello";									
	Reduce DOM Size											
		Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small.										
	Avoid Unnecessary Variables											
		Bad:	var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;									
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;									
		Good:	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName									
	Delay JavaScript Loading											
		Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body, lets the browser load the page first.										
												
Function Hoisting												
	Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.											
	Hoisting applies to variable declarations and to function declarations.											
	Because of this, JavaScript functions can be called before they are declared:											
		myFunction(5);										
		function myFunction(y) {										
			return y * y;									
		}										
	Functions defined using an expression are not hoisted.											
												
Self-Invoking Functions												
	A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.											
	Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().											
	You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.					The self-invoking function only runs once. 						
		(function () {										
			var x = "Hello!!";      // I will invoke myself									
		})();										
												
	A JavaScript function does not perform any checking on parameter values (arguments).											
												
Parameter Rules												
	JavaScript function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.											
	JavaScript functions do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.											
	JavaScript functions do not check the number of arguments received.											
												
Parameter Defaults												
	If a function is called with missing arguments (less than declared), the missing values are set to: undefined											
	If a function is called with too many arguments (more than declared), these arguments can be reached using the arguments object.											
												
Invoking a Function with a Function Method												
	call() and apply() are predefined JavaScript function methods. Both methods can be used to invoke a function, and both methods must have the owner object as first parameter.											
		function myFunction(a, b) {										
			return a * b;									
		}										
		myObject = myFunction.call(myObject, 10, 2);     // Will return 20										
		myArray = [10, 2];										
		myObject = myFunction.apply(myObject, myArray);  // Will also return 20										
												
		The only difference is that call() takes the function arguments separately, and apply() takes the function arguments in an array.										
												
Global Variables												
	In a web page, global variables belong to the window object.											
	Global variables can be used (and changed) by all scripts in the page (and in the window).											
	Variables created without the keyword var, are always global, even if they are created inside a function.											
												
JavaScript Closures												
	var add = (function () {											
	    var counter = 0;											
	    return function () {return counter += 1;}											
	})();											
												
	add();											
	add();											
	add();											
												
	// the counter is now 3											
												
	The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function.											
												
	The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.											
												
	This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.											
												
	This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
